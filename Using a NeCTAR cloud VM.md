## Workshop: Using a NeCTAR cloud virtual machine 

### Case Study: Using parallelisation to speed up "Structure" analyses

This tutorial will demonstrate some basics of setting up and running a VM. We will install packages, download files, and run a demonstration analysis with some optimisation tips.

The aim of the workshop is to make using a NeCTAR cloud a less intimidating experience by walking through some of the common steps in running analyses on a VM.

The audience for this workshop is researchers who:

- Have never used cloud computing but are interested in learning how to do it and how it can help their research.
- Have started using cloud computing, but are finding the learning curve steep.
- Currently use NeCTAR servies and are looking for tips to make better use of the available resources.

The workshop will teach generic skills, and the tools learnt will be applicable to many types of analysis in any discipline. The tutorial will involve a test analysis using an example program called "Structure" with the task manager application "GNU Parallel", such that the analysis is optimised for a VM with a large number of processing cores.

Agenda:

- Introduction to the NeCTAR research cloud and the different ways it can benefit your research.
- Launching a NeCTAR virtual machine instance.
  - SSH keys
  - Allocations and Security settings
  - Launch an instance on the NeCTAR dashboard
  - Connect to your VM
- Exploring your VM
- Installing packages with a package manager
- Downloading and installing packages
- Transferring files to and from the VM
- Running the program "Structure" using "Parallel"
- If there is time: Demonstration of remote desktop connections to your VM, Windows VM, and R-Studio Server VM.

Requirements for the workshop:

- Bring your own laptop (the instructions will cover Windows, Mac and Linux OS)
- Get an account with NeCTAR <https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055377-getting-an-account>
- Install FileZilla (using the package manager for your operating system, or at  <https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client>

Suggestions of preparation for the workshop:

- If you're very unfamiliar with Bash (UNIX) shell commands, try to do at least the first two units of this tutorial <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line>
- You may wish to request additional NeCTAR resource allocation (note, this can take a couple of weeks to be processed) <http://training.nectar.org.au/package05/sections/allocations.html>
